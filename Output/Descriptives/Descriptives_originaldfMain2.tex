Task & Dataset & Notes & foil.type & No..of.Words & No..of.Participants & Words.per.Participant \\ 
  \hline
VLD & AP & North American English; Conditions manipulated two variables (visual contrast, nonword difficulty) & Hard nonwords: matched with target words for positional bigram frequencies; Very hard nonwords: higher positional bigram frequencies than target words & 400 & 447 & 400 \\ 
  VLD & BLP & British English & Differed from the target words in exactly
one subsyllabic segment per syllable.
Matched the target words for syllabic and
subsyllabic structure, transition frequencies of the subsyllabic segments, and morphological structure. & 28,730 & 78 & 28,730 \\ 
  VLD & ELP & North American English & Pronounceable nonwords from changing
one or two letters in a corresponding target word, which can occur in early, middle, or late positions & 40,481 & 816 & 3,373 \\ 
  ALD & AELP & Six speakers (three dialects: Singaporean, American, British) & Orthographically plausible nonwords maintaining at least the first syllable of the target word (for words of three or more syllables) and retaining two-thirds of the target word phonemes in the rest of the syllables & 10,170 & 438 & average \~{}1700 (variable by no. of valid sessions) \\ 
  ALD & MALD & One speaker (Canadian) & Pronounceable nonwords where one-third of the subsyllabic constituents of words were swapped for other segments with similar transitional probabilities & 26,793 & 232 & 26,793 \\ 
  NMG & ELP\_NMG & North American English (same basic word set as VLD\_ELP) & Pronounceable nonwords from changing
one or two letters in a corresponding target word, which can occur in early, middle, or late positions & 40,481 & 444 & 2,530 \\ 
  SD & SDP & North American English; Judgement on whether a word is abstract or concrete & N/A & 10,000 & 312 & 1,000 \\
